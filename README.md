## Live-OSC-Chataigne-Module
controls Ableton-Live via OSC and Chataigne   
.... I am still working on this module ! ASome featured might not work yet, and there might be still some bugs in there...
Ableton-Live is quite complexe to remote...       
this module is an "advanced" version of the basic Ableton-Live-Module which is already integrated in Chataigne

To get this OSC-Module run correctly, you must first install the free [LiveOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) and than activate it in Ableton Live !!    
### Actual Version is 1.0     
Please note the following advices :   
After changing the Number of shown Channels you must save the session (cmd-S) and than reload it (cmd-shift-O)    
Channel Names, Faders and Meters are shown and noticed in the same order as they are VISIBLE and ORDERED in the Albeton-Live Session !! this means that after changing a channel's place you must reset and resync the Data in Chataigne; and if you use "Sub-Groups" the "channel-display" in Chataigne depends if the subgroup is deployed or not...

Please contact me if you have suggestions, demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!   
Have Fun
