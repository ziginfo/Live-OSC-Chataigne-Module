## Live-OSC-Chataigne-Module
controls Ableton-Live via OSC and Chataigne   
.... I am still working on this module ! And there might be still some bugs in there...
Ableton-Live is quite complexe to remote...       
this module is an "advanced" version of the basic Ableton-Live-Module which is already integrated in Chataigne

To get this OSC-Module run correctly, you must first install the free [LiveOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) and than activate it in Ableton Live !!    

Please contact me if you have suggestions, demands or requests and any help is always welcome !!   
Have Fun
